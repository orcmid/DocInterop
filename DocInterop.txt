          DOCUMENT INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT/ASSURANCE BOOTSTRAP
          ========================================================

    This GIT repository is an experiment, hosted on GitHub, for demonstrating
    basic ideas for growing a suite of test documents, procedures, and tools
    that are valuable for the assessment/assurance of interoperability using
    document files in open-standard formats.

    The project produces speciment test documents, procedures, tools and a
    framework for expanding to arbitrary levels of detailed coverage of
    document-format provisions and their consistent interpretation when
    interchanging files among heterogeneous systems.

    The key idea is bootstrapping from an initial structure of simple tests
    and companion material that grows in a principled manner to have greater
    coverage and levels of detail.

    Initial focus is on the OpenDocument Format (ODF) as specified by OASIS
    Standard ODF 1.2,
    <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/05/n140504-cache/#Essentials>.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

    Basic ideas being wrestled to the ground with concrete demonstrations
    here are sketched to some degree in the following resourcs:

      * A view on the conformance of ODF 1.2 document files being sketched at
        <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/06/n140602.htm>

      * Ideas about principles of interoperability assurance that underly a
        proposal for ODF 1.2 Change Tracking, being abstracted for more
        applications as the RCT Principles,
        <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2015/06/n150601.htm>

      * A sketch for developing a spiraling of increasing coverage
        as part of the Apache Corinthia Project (incubating),
        <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Corinthia/ODF>.



INITIAL CONTENT

               ODF/ [TBD] the location for boostrapping of interoperability
                    assessment for the OpenDocument Format

        principles/ [TBD] identification and establishment of meta-principles
                    around this bootstrap procedure and how it can grow in
                    coverage and also serve as a model for addressing more
                    formats

       scaffolding/ [TBD] material for the scaffolding of this repository
                    and collateral materials in a systemantic manner

TODO

 * Establish semantic versioning as the approach for these materials

 * Demonstrate the use of HTML pages when material is accessed in GitHub

 * Determine whether GitHub MarkDown is suitable for the desire to maintain
   a structure of content that can be accessed and navigated in a file system
   and with the use of a web browser.

 * Collect material from Hamilton notebook page #73.37 and earlier.

 * Initiate scaffolding.  Explain the use of these text files in the folders
   of the same name.

 * Initiate principles information, if not to be found elsewhere

 * seed the ODF folder
