          DOCUMENT INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT/ASSURANCE BOOTSTRAP
          ========================================================

    This GIT repository is an experiment, hosted on GitHub, for demonstrating
    basic ideas for growing a suite of test documents, procedures, and tools
    that are valuable for the assessment/assurance of interoperability using
    document files in open-standard formats.

    The project produces speciment test documents, procedures, tools and a
    framework for expanding to arbitrary levels of detailed coverage of
    document-format provisions and their consistent interpretation when
    interchanging files among heterogeneous systems.

    The key idea is bootstrapping from an initial structure of simple tests
    and companion material that grows in a principled manner to have greater
    coverage and levels of detail.

    Initial focus is on the OpenDocument Format (ODF) as specified by OASIS
    Standard ODF 1.2,
    <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/05/n140504-cache/#Essentials>.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

    Basic ideas being wrestled to the ground with concrete demonstrations
    here are sketched to some degree in the following resourcs:

      * A view on the conformance of ODF 1.2 document files being sketched at
        <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/06/n140602.htm>

      * Ideas about principles of interoperability assurance that underly a
        proposal for ODF 1.2 Change Tracking, 
        <http://nfoworks.org/rct/>

      * A sketch for developing a spiraling of increasing coverage of 
        profiles for the envelope within which ODF implementations are
        interoperable, <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2015/06/n150601.htm>.
        This is the web project for which the GitHub DocInterop 
        project develops proofs-of-concept.


INITIAL CONTENT

               ODF/ boostrapping of interoperability assessment for the
                    OpenDocument Format, centered on ODF 1.2

        principles/ identification and establishment of principles that apply
                    to the development of helices that spiral up from basic
                    low-level conformance cases to full-up interoperability
                    assurance, expressed in functional/pattern terms.

       scaffolding/ material for the scaffolding of this repository
                    and collateral materials in a systemantic manner, focused
                    on the plumbing and not the content supported on the
                    scaffolding

TODO

 * Collect material from Hamilton notebook page #73.37 and earlier. 
   [dh:2016-01-22 Now #73.91 and earlier]

 * Add a NOTICE file that simply asserts there is no copyright transfer as
   part of the license and that attribution and notice requirements of the
   license must be honored. [dh:2016-01-22 This is not what NOTICE works
   for.  I may need a CREDITS file for the use of text worked up on the
   Apache Corinthia wiki.]

 * There needs to be some treatment for how notices are placed on derivative
   versions and what happens when others contribute.  Contributions must
   nonetheless have ALv2 licensing.  Compatible licenses (as determined by
   the Apache Software Fouondation) will be considered.

 * Make a recommended practice of back-tracing and provenance for the
   documents.  ALv2 does not require that, but it may be a practice for this
   work.  That would also be appropriate for preserving provenance, attribu-
   tion and back linking were CC-by used on a derivative or new contribution.
   
 * Should I be using git: URL schemes for links here?

 0.0.7 2016-01-22-11:03 Add LICENSE and README, touch-up manifest, text
       The connection with <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2015/06/n150601.htm>
       and the RCT paper is strengthened and more writing will be at 
       nfoWorks and linked from the DocInterop project. 
 0.0.6 2015-12-10-11:04 Add work Item
       Figure out how to preserve assurance helix material from the Corinthia
       CWiki -- probably on nfoWorks.org pages.
 0.0.5 2015-06-18-09:03 Initiate principles/
       The principles/ folder is established and available for further
       development.
 0.0.4 2015-06-18-08:21 Add Licensing Work Items and Principle Concerns
       Need for LICENSE, NOTICE, and additional provenance preservation
       is added to TODO.  Concerns about minimizing foretelling of up-helix
       considerations are raised.
 0.0.3 2015-06-17-19:14 Establish ODF/
       The ODF folder is initiated and work items for creation of the initial
       layer of spiral development are identified there.
 0.0.2 2015-06-17-17:43 Establish scaffolding/
       The scaffolding folder is initiated and work items that anticipated it
       are moved there.
 0.0.1 2015-06-17-10:02 Provide Direct URL
       GitHub browser presentation of this file provides a URL for its
       access.  That is employed as part of scaffolding experimentation.
 0.0.0 2015-06-16-19:08 Placeholcer for boostrappiing the bootstrap.
