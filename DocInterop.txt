          DOCUMENT INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT/ASSURANCE BOOTSTRAP
          ========================================================

    This GIT repository is an experiment, hosted on GitHub, for demonstrating
    basic ideas for growing a suite of test documents, procedures, and tools
    that are valuable for the assessment/assurance of interoperability using
    document files in open-standard formats.

    The key idea is bootstrapping from an initial structure of simple test
    cases and companion material that grows in a principled manner to have
    greater coverage and levels of detail.

    Initial focus is on the OpenDocument Format (ODF) as specified by OASIS
    Standard ODF 1.2,
    <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/05/n140504-cache/#Essentials>.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

    Basic ideas being wrestled to the ground with concrete demonstrations
    here are sketched to some degree in the following resourcs:

      * A view on the conformance of ODF 1.2 document files being sketched at
        <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/06/n140602.htm>

      * Ideas about principles of interoperability assurance that underly a
        proposal for ODF 1.2 Change Tracking,
        <http://nfoworks.org/rct/>

      * A sketch for developing a spiraling of increasing coverage of
        profiles for the envelope within which ODF implementations are
        interoperable, <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2015/06/n150601.htm>.
        This is the web project for which the GitHub DocInterop
        project develops proofs-of-concept.


MANIFEST

               ODF/ boostrapping of interoperability assessment for the
                    OpenDocument Format, centered on ODF 1.2

        principles/ identification and establishment of principles that apply
                    to the development of helices that spiral up from basic
                    low-level conformance cases to full-up interoperability
                    assurance, expressed in functional/pattern terms.

       scaffolding/ material for the scaffolding of this repository
                    and collateral materials in a systematic manner, focused
                    on the plumbing and not the content supported on the
                    scaffolding

TODO

 * Collect material from Hamilton notebook page #73.37 and earlier.
   [dh:2017-04-24 Now #74.47 and earlier]

 * I may need a CREDITS file for the use of any of the text worked up about
   this on the Apache Corinthia incubator wiki.

 * Make a recommended practice of back-tracing and provenance for the
   documents.  ALv2 does not require that, but it may be a practice for this
   work.  This can be by tying to the web site as well as GitHub.  There needs
   to be more connection.

 * Should I be using git: URL schemes for links here?

 * With respect to interoperability assurance, we need to distinguish between
   test assertions, test cases, and test suites.  There is also some patterns
   and practices to consider.  Introduce that at an appropriate level.

 * Update the Security Policy

 * Add a GitHub Pages docs/ folder and content

 * Introduce hybridForm immediately and apply it from the beginning.

 * Add a construction/ structure, maybe replace scaffolding/, which seems to
   be very fuzzy and unclear with respect to purpose.
