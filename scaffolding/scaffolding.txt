                                  ===========

          DOCUMENT INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT/ASSURANCE BOOTSTRAP

    This section of the bootstrap repository is about scaffolding. Scaffolding
    is the underlying structure into which the useful material is organized
    and connected.

    The scaffolding follows certain principles.  This file and the parent-
    directory file DocInterop.txt are examples of the application of some of
    those principles.

    Scaffolding provides the substrate of the project itself.  This is not the
    same as the subject matter of the project, although the scaffolding
    principles do support some of the principles for the subject matter.
    Principles applicable to the subject matter and and the purpose of the
    Document Interoperability Assessment/Assurance effort are covered in the
    separate /DocInterop/principles/ folder.

    As part of bootstrapping, there are some experiments to be conducted on
    how the GitHub archive can be accessed directly as a web of resources.

    Those experiments, the results, and related practices are all covered in
    this folder.

    Technically, the scaffolding is about the document engineering of the
    medium for the content materials.  There are document engineering patterns
    that apply here.  That is not to be belabored.

TODO

 * Establish semantic versioning as the approach for these materials

 * Demonstrate the use of HTML pages when material is accessed in GitHub

 * Determine whether GitHub MarkDown is suitable for the desire to maintain
   a structure of content that can be accessed and navigated in a file system
   and with the use of a web browser.

 * Collect material from Hamilton notebook page #73.37 and earlier.

 * Initiate scaffolding.  Explain the use of these text files in the folders
   of the same name.

 * Explore the provision of absolute URLs in access to content of this kind.
   Using these in the text, as at the top of this page introduced in 0.0.1,
   can lead to all kinds of drift in clones and copies elsewhere.  Scaffolding
   needs to explore this at greater detail.

 * Under scaffolding, use the subordinate attention Polyani distinction,
   with principles being about the focal attention (though not completely?).
   This is kind of a pattern-language issue with regard to change of abstrac-
   tion, and perhaps is unnecesaary here?

 * Account for the .gitignore changes as part of scaffolding also.

 * Find a WYSIWYG HTML Editor.  If I can't get WebMatrix to do it, what else
   can I use?
