# DocInterop: Document Interoperability Assessment/Assurance Bootstrap

The DocInterop repository on GitHub is for experimental development of tests and related material for assessment 
of interoperable provisions among OpenDocument Format (ODF) implementations.

This effort is part of the ***nfoWorks*** [RCT project](http://nfoWorks.org/rct).  It is used for proof-of-concept experiments
toward an [ODF Interoperability Assessment Helix](http://nfoworks.org/notes/2015/06/n150601.htm).
