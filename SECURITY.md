**2024-09-19 Status**: The DocInterop project/repository is a public,
open-source development of materials for testing the interoperability of
document-processing formats and software.

There are no releases of executable code.  Developed test suites are not
expected to contain anything that would expose a threat surface of any kind.

In general, defects and issues should be addressed under the DocInterp Issues
and Discussion topics.  Pull requests are not solicited at this time.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please confine vulnerability reporting to Orcmid on GitHub projects that have supported releases.

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface
that pertains to DocInterop, however unlikely, use the GitHub vulnerability
reporting provision of the
[DocInterop Security](https://github.com/orcmid/DocInterop/security) tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an
ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.

If you wish encrypted responses, sign that message before
encryption in order for your public key to be available for that purpose.
