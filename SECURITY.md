# Security Policy

**2024-09-09 Status**: The DocInterop project/repository is a public, open-source development of materials for testing the
interoperability of document processing software.  As such, it does not produce releases of executable code, and test suites
are not currently expected to contain anything that would expose a threat surface of any kind.

In general, defects and issues should be addressed under the DocInterp Issues and Discussion topics.  Pull requests are not solicited at
this time.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please confine vulnerability reporting to Orcmid on GitHub projects that do have supported releases.  If you believe there is already need
to engage in private discussion about a potential threat or threat-surface defect here on DocInterp, please use the GitHub
vulerability reporting provision of this project's Security tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to 
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have additional concerns about email security/privacy, put your message in an ASCII-armored PGP-encrypted enclosure using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc) public key.
