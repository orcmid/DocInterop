          DOCUMENT INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT/ASSURANCE BOOTSTRAP

    This section of the bootstrap repository is for development of helices
    of materials for the progressive assessment/assurance of ODF document
    interoperability.

    The progression extends through several layers, starting with minimum
    confirmation of ODF document-file conformance and working through
    profiles of processing compliance, application profiling, and assurance
    of interoperability.

    ODF is chosen as the first format to analyze in this manner out of
    convenience and the relative simplicity of ODF in comparison with OOXML.
    The need to established cases of assured  interoperability is also
    important in areas where ODF is proposed for institutional adoption,
    especially in civil administration.

TODO

 * Establish the versions of ODF and how they are to be treated.  Maybe with
   a page on the respective classes.

 * Then set up null documents for the least-acceptable files that can be
   handled with no content.  Technically there might be no null package.

 * Determine what would be the least acceptable ODF 1.2 package.

 * Then Determine what would be the least acceptable ODF 1.2 Document package.

 * Above null documents there may be empty documents.  Those might not be
   different.  Experimentation will determine that.

 * Then do a Hello World minimum document.

 * An important test is to see what software accepts these variations.

 * Another test is to see what is saved when such a document is exported,
   and what additional material is included.

 * Figure out when to breakout into the different document types (Text,
   Spreadsheet, Presentation, etc.)

 * There may need to be a way to kick some considerations up-level into a
   place where they are parked without diving into them.  This may be a
   principle/practice for bootstrapping and kicking some items forward to
   a level that is not yet identified and refined.

 * Global information on standards should be available here.  They can link
   to the archiving at nfoWorks also.

 * Information on software and ODF-supporting products/projects needs to be
   somewhere.  It is not clear where that is.

 * The way of connecting from and connecting into this material is not
   established.  That should be some principled arrangement.

 * Figure out how to structure initial test assertions and somehow work them
   into a helix also.
