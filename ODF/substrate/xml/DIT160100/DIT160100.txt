                    OPEN DOCUMENT FORMAT XML SUBSTRATE
                    ==================================

                  SINGLE-XML NULL ODF-TEXT-DOCUMENT CASE

  [ED.NOTE: PLACEHOLDER FOR DRAFT TO COME]    

    The other specified cases of XML documents as OpenDocument document compo-
    nents will be assessed as part of the Zip substrate assessment.  The
    package substrate will have some parallel cases with the ones here to
    ensure that the more-common in-package use of ODF XML address test cases
    paralleling those introduced here.

TODO

 * Establish a no-brainer case of single XML file OpenDocument Text
   document that should be acceptable to all consumers that accept the single-
   file case.

 * Possibly create variations that exercise different aspects of XML all
   within valid single-file documents.

 * Figure out a simple organization of these actual files, their assessment
   procedures, relevant test assertions, and demonstration of assessment
   results.  This will be part of developing a schema for others.

 * Tests need to link to the test assertions they are part of.  There can be
   test assertions that are also for various profile levels.  For example,
   something like an OpenOffice.org profile, an RCT-level profile, etc.

 * Character set encodings need to be explored, along with some of the Unicode
   characters that have functions similar to basic ASCII controls for white
   space.
   
 * Populate this DIT160100 folder with construction structure and work items
   that apply to only it.
   
 * Determine where the scheme of tests and related assertions for these DIT
   cases should go.
   
 * Rename the singleXML-NUllOpenDocumentTextDocument to shorter form that
   matches the test results.
   
 * Can we do more than one test case in DIT160100, since they are flexed
   off of the base test?
   
 * Describe the test cases in a simple way.
 
 * Describe the specimen results also.
 
 * Need to figure out how to name more results, where to tabulate them, etc.
 
 * This is going to lead to profiling in some manner.  Need to consider 
   where that belongs and how it ties into these.
   
 * Capture what the main platforms do when they do not accept one of these
   documents.
   
 * Distinguish when LibreOffice does and does not accept the unadorned .xml
   file naming.
   
 * Don't forget ODF 1.1 vs ODF 1.2.
 
 * Take TODOs out of the .xml file itself and park them here.
