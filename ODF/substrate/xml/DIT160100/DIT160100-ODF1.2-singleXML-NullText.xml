           DOCINTEROP NULL OPENDOCUMENT TEXT SINGLE XML TEST DOCUMENT
           ==========================================================

     This ODF 1.2 document file demonstrates a null text document in single
     XML file format.  This is a completely legitimate, absolutely minimal
     ODF 1.2 Text Document that happens to have no content.

     The ODF specification does not require that this form of document be
     accepted by an ODF Consumer.  However, if it is recognized and accepted,
     there is no reason for rejection of the details.  It is a document with
     no existing content and one expects that it is presented as a document
     that has no content so far.  This document can be used to see what the
     default interpretation is for this document file when it is accepted.

     The ODF specification also does not specify a MIME type or a file-name
     extension for this form.  This version has extension .xml and is
     otherwise identfied only as a UTF-8 XML file.  The <office:document>
     element is what establishes this being an ODF 1.2 Text document.

     Apart from there being no document content, there is nothing unusual
     about this document file other than the extensive XML comments such as
     this one.  These are all well-formed in accordance with the XML 1.0
     specification and an ODF 1.2 consumer is permitted to simply ignore them.
     There is no interpretation of XML comments provided for ODF 1.2 files.

     [NOTE: This file also relies heavily on the required treatment of
            XML Comments and white space in elements that do not introduce
            textual content according to the ODF 1.2 Schema
            ]
     -->

<office:document
        xmlns:office="urn:oasis:names:tc:opendocument:xmlns:office:1.0"
        office:mimetype="application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text"
        office:version="1.2">

    <!-- In addition to establishment of the correct namespace, the mimetype
         and version attributes are required by the schema for the
         <office:document> element.  The mimetype choices is one for plain
         text document and not one for text-template or text-master.  One
         must be chosen for an OpenDocument Text Document by Single XML file.

         The root <office:document> element is required for single XML file
         format of OpenDocument Documents by clause 2.2.1(C.2) of ODF 1.2
         Part 1.

         An <office:body> element is the only element required by the
         <office:document> schema.
         -->

    <office:body>
        <!-- An <office:text> element is the only element required by the
             <office:body> schema.
             -->
        <office:text>
            <!-- An <office:text> element is required for OpenDocument
                 Text Documents by clause 2.2.3(C) in ODF 1.2 Part 1.
                 In accordance with the schema for <office:text> this
                 element has all optional constructs omitted.  In particular,
                 the office-text-content-main pattern is satisfied by the
                 choice of none-or-more text-content patterns.

                 This is a valid text document having no text content
                 whatsoever.

                 There is an interesting case involving saving this document
                 back out as a test result to demonstrate all the additional
                 XML tags and attributes that are introduced.
                 -->

    </office:body>
</office:document>
