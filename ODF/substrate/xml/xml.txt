                    OPEN DOCUMENT FORMAT XML SUBSTRATE
                    ==================================

          DOCUMENT INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT/ASSURANCE BOOTSTRAP

    XML Documents are employed in several ways as components of ODF documents.

    XML Documents provide a medium for components in several ways:

     * As single XML file ODF documents with root element <office:document>
       (and appropriate namespace binding for the "office" prefix), valid
       according to the specified schema and be name-space well-formed and
       conform to the xml-id specification [ODF1.2-1:2.2.1(C,D.1,D.2).

     * As specific content files of an OpenDocument package, having many
       of the same qualities as single XML file OpenDcument documents.

     * Similarly, as specific content files for subdocuments in an
       OpenDocument package.

     * As special-purpose files in OpenDocument packages for specification
       of a manifest, digital signature, and RDF metadata via XML documents.

    There are no other defined cases of XML documents as components of ODF
    documents.  It is conceivable that a package might contain additional
    XML documents for separate purpose.  There is no explicit provision in
    the ODF 1.0/1.1/1.2 specifications.

    For the substrate case, only the single XML file ODF document can be
    presented as a standalone XML file for simple substrate assessment.  This
    form is very suitable for testing purposes, although not all OpenDocument
    Consumers accept the single XML file case.

    The other specified cases of XML documents as OpenDocument document compo-
    nents will be assessed as part of the Zip substrate assessment.

TODO

 * Establish a no-brainer case of single XML file OpenDocument Text
   document that should be acceptable to all consumers that accept the single-
   file case.

 * Create variations that exercise different aspects of XML all within valid
   single-file documents.

 * Figure out a simple organization of these actual files, their assessment
   procedures, relevant test assertions, and demonstration of assessment
   results.
