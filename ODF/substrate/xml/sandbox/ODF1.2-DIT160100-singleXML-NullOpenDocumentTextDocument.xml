           DOCUMENT INTEROP NULL OPENDOCUMENT TEXT SINGLE XML DOCUMENT
           ===========================================================

     This ODF 1.2 document file demonstrates a null text document in single
     XML file format.  This is a completely legitimate, absolutely minimal
     ODF 1.2 Text Document that happens to have no content.

     The ODF specification does not require that this form of document be
     accepted by an ODF Consumer.  However, if it is recognized and accepted,
     there is no reason for rejection of the details.  It is a document with
     no existing content and one expects that it is presented as a document
     that has no content so far.  This document can be used to see what the
     default interpretation is for this document file when it is accepted.

     Apart from there being no document content, there is nothing unusual
     about this document file other than the extensive XML comments such as
     this one.  These are all well-formed in accordance with the XML 1.0
     specification and an ODF 1.2 consumer is permitted to simply ignore them.
     There is no interpretation of XML comments provided for ODF 1.2 files.

    <!-- In addition to establishment of the correct namespace, the mimetype
         and version attributes are required by the schema for the
         <office:document> element.  The mimetype choices is one for plain
         text document and not one for text-template or text-master.  One
         must be chosen for an OpenDocument Text Document by Single XML file.

         The root <office:document> element is required for single XML file
         format of OpenDocument Documents by clause 2.2.1(C.2) of ODF 1.2
         Part 1.

         An <office:body> element is the only element required by the
         <office:document> schema.

             <office:body> schema.

            <!-- An <office:text> element is required for OpenDocument
                 Text Documents by clause 2.2.3(C) in ODF 1.2 Part 1.
                 In accordance with the schema for <office:text> this
                 element has all optional constructs omitted.  In particular,
                 the office-text-content-main pattern is satisfied by the
                 choice of none-or-more text-content patterns.

                 This is a valid text document having no text content
                 whatsoever.

   TODO

    * Tie to an explanation of the DIT test-document identifiers and rules
      for the XML ones.  Those rules can appeal to anything higher up.

    * Tie to specific resources, such as the annotated schema and other
      materials.

    * Situate this file in its canonical location when we have it.  The
      sandbox location is not permanent.

    * Explain what is ordinary and not meant to be problematic about this
      test file.

    * Tie to some specification of the single XML Test Document null cases.

    * Tie this document into instructions for how it is used to test
      acceptance or not, and also demonstrate what the default becomes when
      the document is accepted by a consuming processor that exports that
      document directly.
