                         OPEN DOCUMENT FORMAT SUBSTRATE
                         ==============================

          DOCUMENT INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT/ASSURANCE BOOTSTRAP

    The ODF Document Format relies upon a substrate on which document files
    are represented.  The document-representation substrate requirements
    include

     * File-system streams and their identification on operating-system
       platforms

     * Association of MIME types with substrate materials

     * Character-set encodings and their identification/detection

     * XML 1.0
       the carrier of most of the document structure and content material,
       profiled in the ODF specification directly and indirectly

     * Zip Packaging
       profiled in the ODF specification for for use as a compound-document
       carrier

     * Zip component streams part of ODF 1.2 packages and part of packages
       used for ODF 1.2 documents and also subdocuments in packages

     * Use of internationalized IRIs in the cross-referencing of materials
       within packages and external to ODF document files

    There are also some higher-level cases that rely on external-specification
    profiles in composing special substrate-like constructions, including

     * Application of digital-signature and encryption techniques to the
       ODF document files

     * Various binary formats that are incorporated in and/or used-from
       ODF document files, including OLE components, binary representations
       of images, etc.

    It is neither intended nor required that document interoperability
    assurance include comprehensive treatment of the technologies that are
    relied upon in the ODF substrate.

    Substrate considerations are identified in an analysis of ODF 1.2
    Conformance, <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/06/n140602.htm>.  See
    the top lines of the diagram at
    <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/06/n140602b.htm>.

TODO

 * Capture the requirements for XML and for Zip at least.  This may be a bit
   difficult and there may need to be folders on this.  It is not at all
   clear what can be done here, except there will be dependencies on it.

 * The ODF 1.2 Conformance note and Matrix needs to be extended to allow these
   dependencies to be elaborated and connected.  DocInterop can reference that
   analysis.

 * Find the general statements with regard to XML and Zip.

 * This is going to take us into Extended Document XML.  This is the easy
   case and we should start there.

 * The handling of Package and Extended Package separate from ODF documents
   needs to be teased out.  The package structure absent ODF content is tricky
   and needs to be grounded before we deal with Extended Document Packages and
   just Conformant Document Packages.  The ODF 1.2 specification is not our
   friend in this respect and it is better to stay with the flat file and
   simple packages having the flat file as content.xml at the beginning.

 * The references to specifications should be at the ODF level unless they
   are peculiar to a given subordinate level here.

 * We do need to tease out the specifications and what is said normatively
   about them for the way ODF relies on them by reference, though.  Hmm.
