                        OPEN DOCUMENT FORMAT SUBSTRATE
                        ==============================

          DOCUMENT INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT/ASSURANCE BOOTSTRAP

    The ODF Document Format relies upon a substrate in which the file
    representations of documents are recorded. The document-representation
    substrate includes

     * File-system streams and their identification on operating-system
       platforms

     * Association of MIME types with substrate materials

     * Character-set encodings and their identification/detection

     * XML 1.0
       the carrier of most of the document structure and content material,
       profiled in the ODF specification directly and indirectly

     * Zip Packaging
       profiled in the ODF specification for use as a compound-document
       container

     * Zip component in ODF 1.2 packages and also subdocuments in packages

     * Use of internationalized IRIs in the cross-referencing of materials
       within packages and external to ODF document files

    There are also higher-level cases that rely on ODF-external specifications
    in composing special constructions, including

     * Application of digital-signature and encryption techniques to the
       ODF document files

     * Various binary formats that are incorporated in and/or used-from
       ODF document files, including OLE components, binary representations
       of images, etc.

    It is neither intended nor required that document interoperability
    assurance include comprehensive and general-purpose assessment of all
    those technologies.  The objective is sufficient assessment to confirm
    interoperable usage among ODF-conformant document representations and
    their consumers/producers.  DocInterop substrate tests carve out surfaces
    of interoperability using enough edge cases reveal deviations from the
    specifications of substrate technologies.

    These are basically smell tests and simple comfirnations.  The only
    reason to extend substrate tests beyound that is if specific disparaties
    come to light.

    Substrate considerations are identified in an analysis of ODF 1.2
    Conformance, <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/06/n140602.htm>.  See
    the top lines of the diagram at
    <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/06/n140602b.htm>.

             xml/ folder for substrate level assessment of XML cases
                  demonstrated by extremely simple ODF documents.

TODO

 * Capture the requirements for XML and for Zip at least.  This may be a bit
   difficult and there may need to be folders on this.  It is not at all
   clear what can be done here, except there will be dependencies on it.

 * The ODF 1.2 Conformance note and Matrix needs to be extended to allow these
   dependencies to be elaborated and connected.  DocInterop can reference that
   analysis.

 * Find the general statements with regard to XML and Zip.

 * This is going to take us into Extended Document XML.  This is the easy
   case and we should start there.

 * The handling of Package and Extended Package separate from ODF documents
   needs to be teased out.  The package structure absent ODF content is tricky
   and needs to be grounded before we deal with Extended Document Packages and
   just Conformant Document Packages.  The ODF 1.2 specification is not our
   friend in this respect and it is better to stay with the flat file and
   simple packages having the flat file as content.xml at the beginning.

 * The references to specifications should be at the ODF level unless they
   are peculiar to a given subordinate level here.

 * We do need to tease out the specifications and what is said normatively
   about them for the way ODF relies on them by reference, though.  Hmm.
