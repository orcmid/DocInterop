                    -------------------------------------

    This folder is for images that are used generally on the docInterop
    web site.  Images and screen captures on specific topics are carried
    in the folios for those topics.

    The docInterop are chosen with the streaming-of-bits nfoWare image in
    mind.

    Note: This folder has no viewable index.md/.html page.  That is by intent.

TODO

 * the nfoWare images are more suitable for docInterop.

 * Adapt a new version of the bit-stream-transfer not using VSD

 * The nfoWareBits images are captured here as work product in the creation
   of a unique docInterop logo based on the streaming of bits between hands.
