                                  PRINCIPLES
                                  ==========

          DOCUMENT INTEROPERABILITY ASSESSMENT/ASSURANCE BOOTSTRAP

    This section of the bootstrap repository is about the principles that
    apply to the development of helices that spiral from low-level conformance
    concerns up through levels of interoperability assurance.

    The principles are at the pattern/functional level.  Inessential (and
    unavoidable) details of implementations are not addressed.  Those are
    found in the scaffolding approach and in the specific format and practice
    choices in the interoperability assessment development for a specific
    document-file format, its open standard, and its interoperabiity profiles.

    As part of bootstrapping, there are some experiments to be conducted.
    Some principles will be identified only as implementation work reveals
    the need for them and their identification in what the actual practice
    becomes.

    An important technique that is yet to be articulated is working of
    cross-helix bridges from test documents to test scripts to test frame-
    works and validation tools, and, ultimately to profile definitions and
    the results of interoperability assessments.  The blending in of test
    assertions (different from test cases and test suites) will be a factor.

TODO

 * Identify how the materials are meant to be static and copyable with
   preservation of provenance and authority, with effective cross-referencing.

 * Cross-referencing and provenance of individual items (e.g., single files)
   needs to be dealt with.

 * Deal with the principles behind some (if not all) of the scaffolding
   practices.

 * Develop a spiraling technique that will deal
   with the situation where even a simple test case will have bearing far
   up the ladder (i.e., even an empty ODF Text document reveals things that
   are essentially implementation-dependent application conventions).  We
   don't want to deal with those when operating at a lower level and we won't
   necessarily know when and where the up-helix treatments will arise, but we
   do need a way to place markers and somehow kick the treatment forward with-
   out deep-ending into its premature handling.

 * Establish how test items identify their provenance and link to associated
   materials.

 * Do principles need something about governance?  It would seem that could
   be a large pattern.  Also, about how the assessment tools are meant to
   be usable by anyone, not just product assurance and QA folk, and assess-
   ments can be made public and community-maintained.

 * Get a handle on how Test Assertions target and are based on particular
   levels, whether specifications or up-stream thingies.  Test Assertions
   will be a way of lacing some elements together across helixes, perhaps.
